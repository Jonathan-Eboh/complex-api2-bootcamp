Link to project: https://void-complex-api-two.netlify.app/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, country news API country data API

An application that allows the user to type select a country from a list and recive severals type of information about that country.
The types of information generated include:

three different news articles 

global/regional/population data

an image of that countries flag

Optimizations:

This was the first application where I was using two APIs, both specializing in differing aspects of the same information category. 
In this case the category is countries and it was a really great learning opportunity to see how using more than one API endpoint targeting related data
can really present a comprehensive and worthwhile experience for the user.
